# Denver Mesh Network
Building a community-owned, decentralized, and resilient wireless network for Colorado.

## Project Overview
Denver Mesh is a community-driven initiative dedicated to building a free and open wireless mesh network across Colorado. We believe in providing a resilient, decentralized alternative to traditional internet service providers, ensuring that our communities have access to a reliable communication network that is owned and operated by the people who use it, especially during emergencies.

This repository serves as the central hub for our software development, documentation, and hardware configurations. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a networking enthusiast, or just curious about what we're building, you've come to the right place.

## Key Features
* Community-Owned: The network is built and maintained by volunteers, with all resources and infrastructure belonging to the community.
* Resilient & Redundant: By its very nature, a mesh network is designed to be self-healing. If a single node goes down, data automatically reroutes through other available nodes, ensuring continuous connectivity.
* Decentralized: There is no central point of control. Every node on the network contributes to its strength and resilience.
* Open Source: All our software, network configuration, and hardware designs are open source, allowing anyone to inspect, improve, and use them.
